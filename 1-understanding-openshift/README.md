# Understanding OpenShift - For Developers

If you have only worked with "plain" Kubernetes you will be very surprised when you see the OpenShift Web Console (Dashboard) for the first time. It takes a bit to get used to it but then you realize that this is not an afterthought but a very well designed tool specifically for developers and for administrators, too. The same is true for `oc`, the OpenShift command line tool. It includes all the functions of the `kubectl` CLI and adds the special capabilities of OpenShift.  

In this workshop we will show you how to create your own OpenShift cluster on the IBM Cloud, and how to use the `oc`CLI and the OpenShift Web Console.

__IMPORTANT:__ An [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) is needed for this workshop! A free IBM Cloud Lite account is not sufficient, you cannot create an OpenShift cluster with a lite account.

There are many good tutorials on the Red Hat OpenShift [Interactive Learning Portal](https://learn.openshift.com/).

The IBM Developer Website has its own section on [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://developer.ibm.com/components/redhat-openshift-ibm-cloud/).
