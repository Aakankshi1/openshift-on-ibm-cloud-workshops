## Understanding OpenShift - For Developers

When I started to work with OpenShift, coming from plain Kubernetes, I was very surprised when I saw the OpenShift Web Console (Dashboard) for the first time. It takes a bit to get used to it but then you realize that this is not an afterthought but a very well designed tool specifically for developers. The same is true for `oc`, the OpenShift command line tool. 

In this workshop we will show you how to create your own OpenShift cluster on the IBM Cloud, and how to use the `oc`CLI and the OpenShift Web Console.



### Part 1: Introduction
