# Deploying Java Microservices to OpenShift on IBM Cloud

This workshop demonstrates how to build a microservice with Java and how to deploy it to OpenShift on the IBM Cloud.

The microservice is kept as simple as possible, so that it can be used as a starting point for other microservices. The microservice has been developed with Java EE and Eclipse MicroProfile.

There are [various ways to deploy applications to OpenShift](http://heidloff.net/article/deploying-open-liberty-microservices-openshift/). This workshop explains how to deploy microservices using the OpenShift CLI (command line tool) 'oc' as well as 'binary builds'.
